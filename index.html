                <h1 class="title">Are cryptocurrencies investment similar to gold?</h1>
                <p>By Vineet Sachdev</p>
                <p>
                    In the last few years there have many media reports which said that investments
                    in cryptocurrencies are similar to digital gold. The meteoric rise in the value
                    of cryptocurrencies in the last decade have attracted hordes of new investors 
                    towards them. Since the production of cryptocurrency is limited in number, they 
                    have been compared to gold for storing value for the investors. We discuss 
                    below whether that comparison is valid.

                <p>
                    We look at the historical price movement of gold and compare it to the price 
                    movement of well-known cryptocurrency - Bitcoin and the S& P 500 equity index 
                    to understand how these asset classes are related. A 30-day rolling average of
                    the data is used to make the comparison.

                <p>
                    The chart shows that while the price of Bitcoin is very volatile, its movement 
                    has mostly been in correlation to the S & P equity index i.e., showing increase 
                    in price when the equity markets are rising and falling when they are down. In
                    contrast the price movement of gold have shown negative correlation. While price 
                    of Bitcoin and S& P index have fallen by around 50% and 20% respectively till
                    date since the beginning of the year as major central banks increase interest
                    rates and war in Ukraine rages on, gold has gained around 1%. This indicates 
                    that cryptocurrencies are not good hedging instrument as gold is for investors 
                    to preserve their investments during times of uncertainty.

                <p>
                    Year end data on prices for bitcoin and gold for past 5 years shows that while
                    gains from cryptocurrency investment have been higher on yearly basis in many 
                    years, investment in this asset class also has the potential to destroy initial 
                    investments too. In comparison- while gold prices may not have grown much, it 
                    has never resulted in much destruction of investor investment. This places gold 
                    as a much safer bet for investments over longer term than cryptocurrencies.

                <p>
                    The above analysis shows that comparing cryptocurrencies to digital gold may not
                    be right since they does not share some of the basic properties of gold investment
                    for their investors.
